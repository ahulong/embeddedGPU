RTAS2014
==========
This folder RTAS2014 contains the input files for all the problem sets that were reported in the paper submitted to RTAS 2014.

The submitted paper reported results only for the convolution kernel. This folder, additionally, has the results for the AES kernel. The AESResults.pdf contains the results obtained with various problem sets for a similar set of experiments as reported in the paper. 

The AES_input.txt contains the input parameters used for the experiments based on the energy model of the AES kernel as shown in paper. The Convolution_input.txt contains the corresponding inputs for the results reported in the paper that were based on the convolution kernel.
